# FPGA Build Flow Automation with Icarus Verilog + EPWave

This project implements a **4-bit up-counter** in SystemVerilog and demonstrates an automated FPGA/ASIC design flow using open-source tools. The design is compiled and simulated with **Icarus Verilog**, waveforms are generated in **dump.vcd**, and visualized with **EPWave/GTKWave**. A shell script (`run.sh`) automates the flow from compilation to waveform viewing.  

**Tools Used:** SystemVerilog, Icarus Verilog, EPWave/GTKWave, Linux Shell, GVim  
**Files:** `design.sv` (RTL), `testbench.sv` (verification), `run.sh` (automation), `dump.vcd` (waveform), `Screenshot.png` (example output)
